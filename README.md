WoT Hive is an implementation of a [W3C Web of Things directory ](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-discovery/). This implementation is compliant with the standard specification but aims at providing enriched features thanks to the usage of other W3C standards related to Semantic Web technologies.

**Checkout our [wiki for more documentation](https://github.com/oeg-upm/wot-hive/wiki)**

**Try the [WoT Hive demo](https://wothive.linkeddata.es/api/things)**, behind this deployment there is a RDF4J triplestore that does not support identifiers like 900de665-6a0b-4d48-abcb-2fb457015ba1, instead add a prefix like uuid:900de665-6a0b-4d48-abcb-2fb457015ba1. This issue is due to the triplestore used by the WoT Hive not the directory itself, other triplestores support the former ids.

##  Docker quick start 
Copy this receipt in a *docker-compose.yml* file

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  triplestore:
    image: acimmino/helio-cloud-rdf4jstore:latest
    ports:
      - '4567:4567'
  wothive:
    image: acimmino/wot-hive:latest
    ports:
      - '9000:9000'
```

Run the docker command

```bash
docker-compose up
```

##  Jar quick start  
##### `Requires a triple store service publishing a SPARQL endpoint to store the Thing Descriptions`
#### 1. Download the WoT Hive service
Download the latest release of WoT Hive into a folder. Notice that the releases have several files that must be downloaded and placed in the same folder:
* **log4j.properties** allows to customise the logs of the service
* **schema.json** allows to perform JSON schema validation over the Thing Descriptions
* **shape.ttl** allows to perform SHACL shapes validation over the Thing Descriptions
* **wothive.jar** is the jar of the service

Once downloaded all the resources in the same folder the service can be ran using the command

```bash
java -jar wothive.jar
```

When the service is up and running a file called *configuration.json* will be created in the directory of the jar.  The service will run by default in port 9000. 
#### 2. Set up the triple store
In order to connect the WoT Hive to a remote triple store a `POST` request must be sent to `/configuration/triplestore` containing the in the body the following JSON

```json
{
    "updateEnpoint": "http://localhost:4567/sparql",
    "queryEnpoint": "http://localhost:4567/sparql",
    "queryUsingGET": true
}
```

Notice that `"queryEndpoint"`and `"updateEndpoint"` must have as value the correct endpoints of the triple store for either querying or inserting data. Finally, if the triple store implements the SPARQL protocol through `GET` requests then leave `"queryUsingGET": true`, otherwise, for using `POST`set it to false `"queryUsingGET": false`.
